General Ideas:
Cars have specific stats per components
    -   Build parts
    -   Buy parts
    -   Research
    -   Stats are out of 100

Tracks weight the importance of component's stats based on the track layout

Log drivers / team's career info

The player manages a team and steps through each race
    -   Selects strategies etc for each race

Need to add weather

Teams have budgets based on sponsors and prize money
    -   marketability stat based on drivers and performance

Drivers have specific stats for different attributes
    -   Driver stats are out of 100
    -   Add traits for drivers that add unique effects. 

A young driver academy feature could be cool. 

TODO:
    Sim::new():
        -   generate teams
            -   for now this may be easier to just hardcode in teams and not worry about new teams. 
        -   make drivers non default? This could be either by random cars / stats or have initial values hardcoded in 
            -   The latter is definitely preferable. 
        -   generate tracks
