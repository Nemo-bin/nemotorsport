Ideas:
Cars have specific stats per components
    -   Build parts
    -   Buy parts
    -   Research
    -   Stats are out of 100

Tracks weight the importance of component's stats based on the track layout

Log drivers / team's career info

The player manages a team and steps through each lap of each race
    -   Selects strategies etc for each race

Need to add weather

Teams have budgets based on sponsors and prize money
    -   marketability stat based on drivers and performance

Drivers have specific stats for different attributes
    -   Driver stats are out of 100
    -   Add traits for drivers that add unique effects. 

A young driver academy feature could be cool. 

Each driver has a race struct:
    -   tracks penalties
    -   tracks driver's every laptime of the race
        -   can be used to determine fastest lap
        -   can be used to sum total time + penalties
    -   tracks dnfs
    -   tracks tyre degradation
    -   tracks fuel
    -   tracks strategy (pits, engine modes, push / lift and coast etc)

TODO:
    Work on race logic
        -   Implement weather
        -   Implement tyre degradation
        -   Implement fuel use
        -   Implement fuel weight impact on lap time
    Team name generation
    May need an algorithm to determine team_average_performance
